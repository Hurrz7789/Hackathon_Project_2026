FloraGuard: Intelligent Environmental & Soil Health Monitor

**Developed by Rubus Labs** *Theme: Pl the **IoT is Bold*** 

## Overview

In today’s busy lifestyle, monitoring the "invisible" health metrics of plants is a significant challenge for indoor gardeners. **FloraGuard** is an integrated embedded system designed to bridge this gap. By leveraging real-time data and visual feedback, it prevents irreversible strain on plant health caused by subtle fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and moisture.

## Key Features

**Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks ambient temperature and humidity using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.


**Visual Feedback:** An 8x8 LED Matrix provides instant status icons (e.g., Green for optimal, Red for temperature spikes).


**Intelligent Analysis:** Interprets environmental data against pre-defined thresholds tailored to specific plant species.

**Data Logging:** Automatically stores hourly readings in CSV format for long-term trend analysis and statistical graphing.


## Hardware & Tech Stack

**Core:** Raspberry Pi 


**Sensors:** Sense HAT (Temperature, Humidity) 


**Imaging:** Camera Module v3 


**Language:** Python
