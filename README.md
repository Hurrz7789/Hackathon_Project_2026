Hackathon Project 2026:  Abstract Submission\n
Group: Hurrain Ghaffar, Irene Kellegher, Izabela Heczkova
Team: Rubus Labs
Project Name: Plant Sensor 
Theme: IoT is Bold

Problem statement:
In today’s busy lifestyle, it is becoming increasingly difficult to monitor the progress of our plants and their physical states due to constant changes in their environments. Changes in temperatures and humidity in the environment have major effects on our plants and neglecting to respond to these changes in the environment can be detrimental to our flora. Indoor gardeners often struggle to maintain consistent growth environments, leading to plant stress or failure due to undetected temperature spikes or drops in humidity.  

Project Solution:
LED Plant Monitor Sensor - Using Sense Hat with Raspberry Pi to create an embedded system which monitors temperature and humidity of soil. The aim of our project is to ensure optimal growth conditions for flora. The embedded system’s aim is to check whether the soil is too wet, dry or moderate, hence displaying warning signs on Sense Hat to alert users of the soil condition. Using Python we will perform data analysis to create thresholds for soil temperature, indicating the current state of soil using LED sensors and whether it is wet, dry, or at optimum state. 

Roles:
Hurrain – Code Development (Python) & Documentation (GitHub)
Irene – Hardware Setup & System Testing 
Izabela – Project Manager & Problem Analyst
